Perfect 👍 You want a **README.md** that clearly explains your Employee Management System project, includes instructions, and has placeholders for screenshots. Here’s a detailed one (formatted in Markdown):

# 🏢 Employee Management System (C++)

This is a **C++ project** that demonstrates the concepts of **Inheritance, Pointers, Arrays of Objects, and Dynamic Memory Allocation (`new`/`delete`)**.  
It allows managing employees of two types: **Full-Time** and **Part-Time**, storing their details, displaying them, and deleting records.

---

## 🚀 Features
- Add **Full-Time Employees** (with bonus)  
- Add **Part-Time Employees** (with working hours)  
- Display all employee details (using polymorphism)  
- Delete all employee records (with dynamic memory cleanup)  
- Demonstrates **hybrid input system** (ask how many employees → loop with `for`)  

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **C++** (Object-Oriented Programming concepts)
- **Inheritance**
- **Polymorphism**
- **Dynamic Memory Allocation**

## 📘 Concepts Covered

* **Encapsulation** (using getters & setters)
* **Inheritance** (`FullTimeEmployee` and `PartTimeEmployee` derived from `Employee`)
* **Polymorphism** (`display()` overridden in derived classes)
* **Dynamic Memory Allocation** (`new` and `delete`)
* **Hybrid Approach for Input** (ask "How many employees?" → loop)
